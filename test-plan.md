# Security-Focused Testing Plan

## Unit Testing

### Security Components Testing
- [ ] Test `ConfigValidator` class for proper validation of all security parameters
- [ ] Test error handling in `AppError` class
- [ ] Test rate limiting middleware with various request scenarios
- [ ] Test authentication middleware with valid and invalid credentials
- [ ] Test GDPR compliance features including data access and deletion

### IPFS Service Testing
- [ ] Test encryption/decryption of content before IPFS pinning
- [ ] Test validation of content metadata and options
- [ ] Test error handling for failed Pinata API requests
- [ ] Test pin list retrieval with filtering options
- [ ] Test unpinning functionality with various scenarios

### Dashboard API Testing
- [ ] Test security metrics endpoint for accurate data
- [ ] Test validation status endpoint for proper error reporting
- [ ] Test manual validation triggering
- [ ] Test access control for different user roles

## Integration Testing

### End-to-End Workflows
- [ ] Test complete upload, encryption, pinning, and retrieval workflow
- [ ] Test content validation workflow with valid and invalid content
- [ ] Test GDPR data subject request workflows
- [ ] Test dashboard data flow from backend to frontend visualization

### API Integration
- [ ] Test Pinata API integration with actual credentials
- [ ] Test alerting system integration with email service
- [ ] Test Prometheus metrics collection
- [ ] Test security monitoring integrations

## Security Testing

### Penetration Testing
- [ ] Conduct OWASP Top 10 vulnerability assessment
- [ ] Test for authentication bypass vulnerabilities
- [ ] Test for authorization bypass vulnerabilities
- [ ] Test for injection vulnerabilities in API endpoints
- [ ] Test for rate limiting effectiveness
- [ ] Test for proper HTTPS configuration

### Static Analysis
- [ ] Run ESLint with security plugins
- [ ] Run SonarQube analysis for security issues
- [ ] Implement npm audit for dependency vulnerabilities
- [ ] Run type checking with strict TypeScript configuration

## Performance Testing

### Load Testing
- [ ] Test API performance under normal load
- [ ] Test API performance under heavy load
- [ ] Test rate limiting under DDoS simulation
- [ ] Measure response times for critical security operations

## Compliance Testing

### GDPR Compliance
- [ ] Test data access request functionality
- [ ] Test data deletion request functionality
- [ ] Test data retention policy enforcement
- [ ] Verify privacy notice and consent mechanisms

### PCI Compliance
- [ ] Test sensitive data handling procedures
- [ ] Verify encryption of data at rest and in transit
- [ ] Test access control for payment-related functionalities
- [ ] Verify audit logging meets requirements

## Documentation Testing

- [ ] Verify all API endpoints are documented with security requirements
- [ ] Test documentation examples for accuracy
- [ ] Verify security procedures are documented
- [ ] Test runbooks for security incident response

## Implementation Plan

1. Set up Jest testing framework with TypeScript support
2. Create test utilities for common testing scenarios
3. Implement unit tests for core security components
4. Implement integration tests for critical workflows
5. Set up CI pipeline for running tests on every commit
6. Implement security scanning tools in the pipeline
7. Create performance testing scripts
8. Document all testing procedures and results
