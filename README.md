# Security-Focused IPFS Pinning Service

A secure TypeScript application for pinning content to IPFS via Pinata with robust security features, monitoring, and type safety.

## Features

- **IPFS Integration**: Secure pinning of JSON and files to IPFS via Pinata
- **Security Features**:
  - Rate limiting to prevent abuse
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - CORS protection
  - Error handling with operational/programming error distinction
  - Authentication and authorization
  - Type safety throughout the application
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics for request tracking and performance monitoring
- **Documentation**: API documentation with access control based on user role

## Testing

The application includes comprehensive testing to ensure security and reliability:

### Unit Tests

Run unit tests with:

```bash
npm test
```

Unit tests cover:
- Config validation
- Error handling
- Rate limiting
- Metrics collection
- IPFS controller functionality

### Integration Tests

Run integration tests with:

```bash
npm run test:integration
```

These tests verify full API workflows including:
- Pinning content to IPFS
- Retrieving pin lists
- Unpinning content
- Security features like rate limiting and CORS

### Security Tests

Run security tests with:

```bash
npm run test:security
```

Security tests include:
- OWASP Top 10 vulnerability checks
